<b>Scientific Name:</b> Siebenrockiella leytensis<br>\
<b>Description:</b> The Philippine Forest Turtle, also known as the Leyte Pond turtle, is a critically endangered species of turtle endemic to the Philippines. This small freshwater turtle is primarily found on the islands of Leyte and Samar in the central Philippines. It inhabits lowland and montane forests, as well as nearby freshwater streams and ponds.<br>\
<b>Size:</b> The Philippine Forest Turtle is a relatively small turtle, with a carapace (upper shell) length of about 15 to 20 centimeters. It has a dark brown to blackish shell with a slightly serrated posterior edge. The skin is typically dark with yellowish markings.<br>\
<b>Habitat:</b> This species is associated with freshwater habitats in and around forests, including streams, ponds, and marshy areas. It spends a significant amount of time in the water but also ventures onto land.<br>\
<b>Diet:</b> The diet of the Philippine Forest Turtle consists of various invertebrates, small aquatic animals, and plant matter.<br>\
<b>Conservation Status:</b> The Philippine Forest Turtle is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It faces significant threats, including habitat loss due to deforestation, collection for the pet trade, and potential predation by introduced species.<br>\
<b>Conservation Efforts:</b> Conservation efforts are underway to protect and conserve this species. These include habitat preservation, captive breeding programs, and educational initiatives to raise awareness about the importance of conserving the Philippine Forest Turtle.<br>\
<b>Unique to Leyte and Samar:</b> The Philippine Forest Turtle is unique to the Philippines, specifically to the islands of Leyte and Samar. Its restricted range makes it particularly vulnerable to localized threats.<br>\
<b>Ongoing Conservation:</b> Conservation organizations and local authorities are working to monitor and safeguard the remaining populations of the Philippine Forest Turtle to ensure the survival of this critically endangered species. The ongoing conservation efforts emphasize the need for habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, and community involvement to protect these turtles and their ecosystems.', 'LEYTE TURTLE.jpg')" coords="350,257,357,281,366,258" shape="poly">

<b>Scientific Name:</b> Cynocephalus volans<br>\
The Philippine Flying Lemur is not actually a lemur, and it is more commonly referred to as the Philippine Flying Lemur or the Philippine Colugo. It belongs to the order Dermoptera and is the only extant species within this order. Despite its name, the Philippine Flying Lemur is not closely related to true lemurs, which are primates found in Madagascar.<br>\
<b>Distinctive Features:</b> The Philippine Flying Lemur has a distinctive appearance with a large, gliding membrane, called a patagium, that extends between its limbs and tail. This adaptation allows it to glide effortlessly through the air. Its body is covered in dense fur, which is usually gray or brown, providing it with camouflage in its natural habitat. It has large, round eyes and a flattened face.<br>\
<b>Habitat:</b> The Philippine Flying Lemur is native to the Philippines and can be found in various forested habitats, including primary and secondary forests. It is arboreal and spends most of its life in trees. Its gliding ability helps it move efficiently between trees in search of food. The diet of the Philippine Flying Lemur primarily consists of leaves, fruits, and sometimes insects. These animals are primarily nocturnal, being more active during the night. They are solitary creatures and are known for their quiet and elusive nature. Female Philippine Flying Lemurs give birth to a single offspring at a time. The young are born relatively undeveloped and require significant maternal care.<br>\
<b>Conservation Status:</b> The conservation status of the Philippine Flying Lemur is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats include habitat loss due to deforestation and hunting.<br>\
<b>Origin and Distribution:</b> In terms of its origin, the Philippine Flying Lemur is believed to have originated in the Philippines. Its distribution is limited to the islands of the Philippines, including Luzon, Mindanao, Leyte, Samar, and surrounding smaller islands. The species has adapted to the diverse forested environments found across these islands. Despite being called a flying lemur, it is important to note that it is not a lemur and has a unique evolutionary history within the order Dermoptera.', 'LEMUR BOHOL.jpg')" coords="327,297,334,320,345,299" shape="poly">

The Visayan spotted deer is native to the Visayan islands in the central Philippines.<br>\
<b>Description:</b> The Visayan spotted deer is a small to medium-sized deer with a distinct coat pattern of white spots on a dark brown background. Adult males typically have antlers, while females are usually smaller and lack antlers. The species is primarily found in the dense and tropical rainforests of the Visayan islands, which include Negros, Panay, and possibly Masbate.<br>\
<b>Conservation Status:</b> The Visayan spotted deer is listed as Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The main threats to its population include habitat loss due to deforestation, hunting, and fragmentation of its natural habitat. The population of the Visayan spotted deer has significantly declined over the years, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve the remaining individuals.<br>\
<b>Conservation Initiatives:</b> Various conservation initiatives are in place to save the Visayan spotted deer from extinction. These efforts include habitat protection, captive breeding programs, and community involvement in conservation activities. The Visayan spotted deer plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a herbivore, contributing to seed dispersal and influencing vegetation dynamics in its habitat.<br>\
<b>Captive Breeding:</b> Captive breeding programs have been established to help increase the population of the Visayan spotted deer in a controlled environment. These programs aim to eventually reintroduce individuals into their natural habitat.<br>\
<b>Collaborative Conservation:</b> Conservation organizations and local authorities are working together to address the challenges faced by the Visayan spotted deer and ensure the long-term survival of this species in the wild.', 'NEGROS DEER.jpg')" coords="285,297,292,318,302,298" shape="poly">

The whale shark is the largest known extant fish species and is known for its impressive size and distinctive spotted pattern. Whale sharks are the largest fish in the world, with adults reaching lengths of up to 40 feet (12 meters) or more. They have a unique spotted pattern on their skin, and their mouths can be up to 1.5 meters wide. Despite their large size, they are filter feeders, primarily consuming plankton and small fish.<br>\
<b>Habitat:</b> Whale sharks are found in warm tropical and subtropical waters around the globe. They can be seen in open oceans, near coastlines, and around coral reefs. Whale sharks are known for their long-distance migrations. While they may cover large distances, some individuals are known to return to specific locations regularly.<br>\
<b>Conservation Status:</b> The whale shark is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to threats like habitat loss, ship strikes, and fisheries. The Philippines is one of the countries where whale sharks are commonly spotted. Oslob, located in the southern part of Cebu, is particularly famous for its whale shark interactions. In Oslob, local fishermen started feeding whale sharks in the early 2010s, attracting them to the area. Tourists are allowed to snorkel and swim with these gentle giants under regulated conditions. Other locations in the Philippines, such as Donsol in Sorsogon and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, are also known for whale shark sightings.<br>\
<b>Conservation Efforts:</b> Conservation efforts in the Philippines aim to balance the tourism industrys interest in whale sharks with the need to protect these creatures. Regulations are in place to ensure responsible and sustainable tourism practices. Educational programs also help raise awareness about the importance of conserving whale sharks and their habitats.', 'WHALE SHARK CEBU.jpg')" coords="315,275,324,296,331,276" shape="poly">
